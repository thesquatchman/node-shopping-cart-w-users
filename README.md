# Node Shopping Cart with Users
This project is an experiment with building a node/express based shopping cart. Thanks to https://gabrieleromanato.name/nodejs-how-to-create-an-e-commerce-shopping-cart for the tutorial and jumping off point, and https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens for the jwt tutorial.

Uses an .env file int the root with some of the variable that I may not want on github

    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/cart
    PORT=3000
    SECRET=Secret
    PAYPAL_EMAIL=test@example.com

Added some products to the database via Postman to get started.
